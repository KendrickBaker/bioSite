            <h2>Biography: </h2>
            <p>Felicia McCullen was born in Garland Texas, to Mary McCullen and Jim McCullen, in the winter of 1979. Growing up Felicia was always very intelligent, at 3 she knew phone numbers for her grandparents and could call them. She was often sick, but never let that keep her down, she often made up her own games to play as a result. Felicia did not want to go to preschool and said that she would teach herself her numbers and letters off of Sesame Street, which she did. Felicia went on to complete school and become the first one of her siblings to graduate with a degree despite having a degenerative muscle disease that made it take 7 years to complete her degree. She also went on to get her teacher certificate which made it possible to teach others how to learn, just as she taught herself as a small child. Now she spends her days teaching people of all walks of life how to study better to reach their goals. For instance she taught a bunch of nursing students how to study more efficiently and as a results the passing raye of the class for the NCLEX increased by 200 points more compared to groups who had not studied with her.  Nowadays, the goal that Felicia is putting her energy towards is to complete the novel she has been working on for several years. I think it is safe to say that she has the ability to accomplish any goal she puts her energy towards.</p>
