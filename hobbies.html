        <h2>Inspirational Piece:</h2>
        <p>My interview subject , Felicia McCullen, said that her hobbies were both scrapbooking and reading. She also commented on how she liked to write as well. All of these can be seen as varying forms of escapism, which is quite interesting. She uses reading to escape into the worlds of others characters and to live vicariously through the emanations of other authors. Also to learn about different perspectives. Writing is where she can create her own worlds to escape into. She has all the creative power in that arena, free to pose difficult tasks on her creations, or to imagine them living peaceful lives. Finally Scrapbooking, is a way to escape into her memories. It helps when times are bad to remember when times were good, and scrapbooking helps one to recall those good memories. 
          I was inspired by her hobbies to look more into writing. According to several sites and authors the hardest part of writing a book, is to start. The beginning of a book can seem daunting, especially when you consider you have to create a whole entire world. Then you have to go back and fill out all the little details to make the world somewhere your readers can entrenched. Otherwise, if no one wants to read the story you tell, because it is bland and flavorless what is the point of writing in the first place. Dorothy A. Windsor says” The hardest part of writing is sticking to a story even when the first draft is terrible.” I agree this is very hard, and if you get discouraged at the start because of this, it can make the rest of the writing a miserable process.</p>
